## Overview:

S.Miles is a bijou Pygame created in the first weeks of a 16 week, full-stack development course at DigitalCrafts in Atlanta.  
In this vignette we meet Samantha Miles. Her journey is unclear, her destination is undefined, but her motivation is unrelenting. During her passage, _Smiles_, as she is known to her friends, is confronted by many strangers. Smiles accepts the task of helping those she meets and these strangers soon become friends. Smiles's actions, however selfless they appear, result in dangerous consequences and ultimately our hero Smiles must confess to her greatest fear -- her own limitations.
